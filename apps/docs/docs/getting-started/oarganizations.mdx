Organization Groups allow you to group your Salesforce orgs so you can work in isolation.

# Overview

Let's say that you are a consultant and you are working with multiple clients. You can create a Group per client so that when you are doing work for that client, only the Salesforce orgs associated with that client will show up.

# Creating and Managing Groups

If you don't yet have groups, you can get to the [groups](http://getjetstream.app/app/org-groups) page by navigating to the home page (click the waffle icon in the navbar) and then click **Manage Groups**.

If you already have a group created, you will see the group switcher above the Salesforce Org dropdown at the top of the page.

## Creating a Group

To create a Group, click the **+ Create New Group** button at the top of the page and choose a name.

:::tip

The organization page is also a great place to manage all of your Salesforce orgs!

## Assigning Salesforce Orgs to a Group

You can move orgs by dragging and dropping them on the desired group or to the **Unassigned** card.

## Choosing a Group

To make a group active, click the **Make Active** button on the group card. Alternatively, you can use the group switcher at the top of the page to quickly do so.

## Deleting a Group

You can delete a group by clicking the dropdown menu and choosing **Delete**.

:::tip

Any Salesforce orgs associated with a deleted group will still exist without a group.
