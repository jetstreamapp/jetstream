Your history records will be synced across your devices and optional to the Chrome Extension, if enabled.

We currently support the following data history and will be adding more in the future:

- Query History
- Saved Load Mappings

:::

Sync your history to the Jetstream server so that you don't lose all of your history when you switch devices or open Jetstream in Incognito mode.

History sync is **opt-in when using the Chrome Extension** in case you want to favor privacy over convenience, clicking on the browser extension icon in Chrome will give you the option to enable this feature.

View the Chrome Extension options for more details [Chrome Extension](../chrome-extension/chrome-extension.mdx).

If you would like to disable sync or need to re-sync all of your data, [Visit the settings page](../../user-profile-and-settings/user-profile.mdx).
