## Adding your first org

After logging in to Jetstream for the first time, you need to connect Jetstream to one or more of your Salesforce orgs.

Jetstream uses OAuth2 for org connections, which means that Jetstream never gains access directly to your password.

To add an org, click the <button className="button button--link">+ Add Org</button> button at the top of the page.

You will be asked to choose an org type which is used to determine the which Salesforce login page to redirect you to for authorization.

- **Production / Developer**
  - `https://login.salesforce.com`
- **Sandbox**
  - `https://test.salesforce.com`
- **Pre-release**
  - `https://prerellogin.pre.salesforce.com`
- **Custom Login URL**
  - `https://my--domain.my.salesforce.com`

### Jetstream IP Addresses

If you need to whitelist IP addresses for your org, Jetstream will use one of the following three ip addresses:

- `3.134.238.10`
- `3.129.111.220`
- `52.15.118.168`
