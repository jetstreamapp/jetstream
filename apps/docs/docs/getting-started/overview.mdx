## Adding your first org

After logging in to Jetstream for the first time, you need to connect Jetstream to one or more of your Salesforce orgs.

Jetstream uses OAuth2 for org connections, which means that Jetstream never gains access directly to your password.

To add an org, click the <button className="button button--link">+ Add Org</button> button at the top of the page.

You will be asked to choose an org type which is used to determine the which Salesforce login page to redirect you to for authorization.

- **Production / Developer**
  - `https://login.salesforce.com`
- **Sandbox**
  - `https://test.salesforce.com`
- **Pre-release**
  - `https://prerellogin.pre.salesforce.com`
- **Custom Login URL**
  - `https://my--domain.my.salesforce.com`

:::info

Starting in September 2025, [Salesforce requires that all 3rd party connected apps are installed](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005132365&type=1) in your org for any new authorizations.

If you are a System Administrator, you may be unaffected if you have not modified the "Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps" setting, which Salesforce set on all System Administrator profiles by default.

After you attempt to Login to Jetstream, you will see <code>Jetstream</code> show up in the list on the <code>Manage Connected Apps</code> setup page.

You will need to click "Install" and then you can configure your desired security policies for the connection.

Jetstream will **NEVER** communicate with Salesforce APIs without your explicit authorization and will never do so in the background or for any actions you have not explicitly taken while using Jetstream.

Refer to the [Salesforce Connected App documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.connected_app_manage.htm&type=5) for additional information.

### Authorization

When you are authorizing with Salesforce, you will see a consent screen with the following permission requests:

| Permission                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access the identity URL service   | Provide access to your unique identifier and basic user profile information.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Manage user data via Web browsers | Allows logging in using "[frontdoor](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000386254&language=en_US&type=1)" login, this means when you click a link from Jetstream, you will be auto-logged in if you were not already logged in. |
| Manage user data via APIs         | Allows Jetstream to communicate with Salesforce.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Perform requests at any time      | Allows Jetstream to store "refresh tokens" so that you don't need to continuously re-connect your Salesforce org to Jetstream.                                                                                                            |
