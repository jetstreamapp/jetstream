If you are having problems connecting to Salesforce, here are some tips to help you resolve any issues.

### Jetstream IP Addresses

If you need to allow IP addresses for your org, Jetstream will use one of the following three ip addresses:

- `3.134.238.10`
- `3.129.111.220`
- `52.15.118.168`

### Installing Jetstream

:::info

Starting in September 2025, [Salesforce requires that all 3rd party connected apps are installed](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005132365&type=1) in your org for any new authorizations.

If you are a System Administrator, you may be unaffected if you have not modified the "Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps" setting, which Salesforce set on all System Administrator profiles by default.

After you attempt to Login to Jetstream, you will see <code>Jetstream</code> show up in the list on the <code>Manage Connected Apps</code> setup page.

You will need to click "Install" and then you can configure your desired security policies for the connection.

Jetstream will **NEVER** communicate with Salesforce APIs without your explicit authorization and will never do so in the background or for any actions you have not explicitly taken while using Jetstream.

Refer to the [Salesforce Connected App documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.connected_app_manage.htm&type=5) for additional information.

:::

After you attempt to connect your Salesforce Org, you should be able to see the connection in Salesforce settings under the **Connected Apps OAuth Usage** option.

From here you have the option to **install** the **Jetstream Connected App**, which will allow you to configure security policies for the connection.

- **Permitted Users** - You can restrict the connection to Admin users.
- **IP Relaxation** - You can configure unique IP address restrictions for this connection.
- **Refresh Token Policy** - Jetstream uses OAuth2 which means there is a short-lived `accessToken` and a long lived `refreshToken` which is used for Jetstream to call Salesforce APIs without ever having direct access to your password.
  - You can adjust the settings here based on your desired security preferences.
- **Session Policies** - You can control how you want your session for your `accessToken` and `refreshToken` to behave

Based on your Refresh Token and Session policies, this will control how often you need to re-authorize your org from within Jetstream. If your `refreshToken` expires, then you will need to re-authorize.
