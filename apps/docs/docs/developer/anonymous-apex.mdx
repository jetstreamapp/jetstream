You can execute anonymous apex using Jetstream, just like the developer console, but with a much better code editor and log viewing experience.

Enter in your apex and press **Submit** (or ctrl/cmd+enter) to execute the apex and see the results on the right-hand side of the page.

Changing the **log levels** will determine how much detail is returned in the log from Salesforce.

:::tip

Each time you execute, Jetstream will save the apex in your history so you can easily recall it and execute the code again.

:::

You can search the results using the built-in filter and can also toggle to only show the debug statements from the log.
