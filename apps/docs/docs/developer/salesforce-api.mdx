The Salesforce API page allows you to call any Salesforce API and view the results. This is great for testing or exploring.

Try submitting a `GET` request to `/services/data/v52.0/` to discover other available endpoints.

Each time you submit a successful API request, Jetstream saves this and you can use that api request again in the future by clicking the History drop-down at the top of the page.

:::tip

Click the **folder** icon at the top to see a list of common Salesforce endpoints.
