Create records without having to worry about which fields are included on a Page Layout.

1. Select the object you want to create records for
2. If applicable, change the Record Type to the desired type
3. Fill out the form and save

<img src={require('./create-record-without-file.png').default} alt="Create record without file" />

After you have created a new record, the id will be shown near the save button and you can click to open the record summary.

<img src={require('./created-record-summary.png').default} alt="Created record summary" />
