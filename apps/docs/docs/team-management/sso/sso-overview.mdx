Before configuring an identity provider for your Jetstream team, ensure that you have [verified your organization's domain](./domain-verification.mdx) ownership.

After your domain is verified, you can proceed to set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for your Jetstream team using one of the supported identity providers or a custom OIDC or SAML provider.

Refer to the following guides to configure SSO with your chosen identity provider:

- [Azure AD](./sso-azure.mdx)
- [Google](./sso-google.mdx)
- [Okta](./sso-okta.mdx)
- [Other OIDC or SAML Providers](./sso-generic.mdx)
