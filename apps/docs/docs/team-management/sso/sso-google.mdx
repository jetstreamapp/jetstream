:::tip

Before configuring Google as an identity provider for your Jetstream team, ensure that you have [verified your organization's domain](./domain-verification.mdx) ownership.

:::

You can set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for your Jetstream team using Google as an **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** provider or as a **SAML** provider.

## Configure Google Workspace for OIDC SSO

### Add SSO provider in Jetstream

Choose "Add SSO Provider" from your Team Dashboard and select "OIDC" as the provider.

Enter `https://accounts.google.com` as the Issuer URL and click "Auto-Discover Endpoints".

### Create an Application

To connect your Google tenant as an identity provider, you must create an OIDC application.

Go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and choose the project to add your new application to
or create a new project.

Select **APIs & Services** from the dashboard, then **Credentials** in the left-hand navigation.

Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.

<img src={require('./images/sso-google-create-app-1.png').default} alt="Create OAuth Client ID" />

Choose Web application as your Application type.

Enter a Name for the application and add the **Authorized Javascript Origins** and **Authorized Redirect URIs** below.

**Authorized Javascript Origins:**

```
https://getjetstream.app
```

**Authorized Redirect URIs:**

You will need to replace `{uuid}` with your Jetstream team's unique identifier obtained from the Team Dashboard when adding the SSO provider.

```
https://getjetstream.app/api/auth/sso/oidc/{uuid}/callback
```

<img src={require('./images/sso-google-create-app-2.png').default} alt="Authorized Redirect URIs" />

Select **Create**.

Make sure to copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** as you will use them in the next step to configure your Google connection.

### Configure Connection

Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** obtained from the Google Developer Console into the corresponding fields in the Team Dashboard when adding the SSO provider.

If needed, you can adjust the attribute mappings to match your organization's user attributes, but **this is typically not necessary for Google**.

### Assign Access (Optional)

:::tip

If you want to restrict access to Jetstream to specific organizational units or groups within your Google workspace, you can assign access to the application you created.

Depending on your organization's policies, this step may be required to allow users to authenticate using Google SSO.

:::

Assign users or groups in your organization to Jetstream to allow them to authenticate using Google SSO.

Go to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com) and select **Directory > Organizational** units in the left-hand navigation.

If applicable, select **Create organizational unit** to create a unit under your primary unit.

Go to **Directory > Users** and add a new user or select an existing one.

Within the selected user, click **Change organizational unit** and choose the applicable unit.

Go to **Security > Access and data control > API controls** in the left-hand navigation and click **Manage Third-Party App Access**.

Select **Add app**, then **OAuth App Name Or Client ID**.

Paste the **Client ID** from the application you created in the search field and Search.

Click on the selected app and **Access to Google** data to assign organization units access and **Save**.

### Enable the connection

After saving the connection, make sure to check the "Enable SSO" checkbox to enable SSO for your team.

You can optionally allow users with specific roles to bypass SSO, by default this is enabled for administrators.

## Configure Google Workspace for SAML SSO

### Add SSO provider in Jetstream

Choose "Add SSO Provider" from your Team Dashboard and select "SAML" as the provider.

Leave this modal open while you configure the SAML application in Google as you will need to copy values between the two.

<img src={require('./images/saml-jetstream-config-modal.png').default} alt="SAML configuration modal" />

### Create a new SAML App

Go to the [Google Admin Portal](https://admin.google.com)

Select **Apps > Web and mobile apps**.

In the Add **App menu**, select **Add custom SAML app**.

<img src={require('./images/google-saml-add-app.png').default} alt="Add custom SAML app" />

### Add App Details

<img src={require('./images/google-saml-app-details.png').default} alt="Add App Details" />

Enter App Name of App (e.g. Jetstream)

set an optional description

upload an optional app icon - here are some options:

- https://getjetstream.app/assets/images/jetstream-icon-pro-128.png
- https://getjetstream.app/assets/images/jetstream-icon.png
- https://getjetstream.app/assets/images/jetstream-icon-white-bg.png

Note: there is a Google bug where the icon preview may look distorted after uploading, but the actual icon should display correctly.

click Continue.

### Configure Metadata

Download the IDP metadata XML file and upload to Jetstream in the **Upload IdP Metadata XML (optional)** field.

The rest of the form should populate automatically after uploading the metadata file. If not, you can manually enter the values.

click Continue.

:::tip

Make sure that your certificate is not expiring soon, after you save you will have the option to generate a new certificate if needed.

When your certificate is close to expiring, we will send a notification and show a banner when administrators are logged in.

### Configure Service Provider Details

Leave all other fields as default and click Continue.

### Configure Attribute Mapping

Configure the attribute mapping for the following fields:

- **Primary email** -> `email`
- **First Name** -> `firstName`
- **Last Name** -> `lastName`

click Finish.

### Assign Access

Once the connection is configured, you need to configure which users or groups in your Google workspace should have access to Jetstream.

To make the app available to all users, select **ON for everyone** in the User Access card for the app you just created.

To make the managed app available to select users, choose a group or organizational unit. Refer to Google's documentation for more details - there is a link in your Google dashboard

### Enable the connection

After saving the connection, make sure to check the "Enable SSO" checkbox to enable SSO for your team.

You can optionally allow users with specific roles to bypass SSO, by default this is enabled for administrators.
