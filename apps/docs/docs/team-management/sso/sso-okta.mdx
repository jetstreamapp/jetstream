:::tip

Before configuring Okta as an identity provider for your Jetstream team, ensure that you have [verified your organization's domain](./domain-verification.mdx) ownership.

:::

You can set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for your Jetstream team using Okta as an **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** provider or as a **SAML** provider.

## Configure Okta Workspace for OIDC SSO

### Add SSO provider in Jetstream

Choose "Add SSO Provider" from your Team Dashboard and select "OIDC" as the provider.

### Create an Application in Okta

Go to your Okta admin dashboard and navigate to **Applications** in the top menu, then click **Create App Integration**.

Choose **OIDC - OpenID Connect** as the Sign-in method, ensure **Web Application** is selected, and click **Next**.

Enter an Application Name and copy and paste in the Redirect URI from the Team Dashboard in Jetstream. It will be in the format:

```
https://getjetstream.app/api/auth/sso/oidc/{uuid}/callback
```

Optionally choose to assign the app to specific groups or users in your Okta directory.

Click **Save** to create the application.

Take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** generated for your new application as you will need these to configure the connection in Jetstream.

It is recommended that you enable the **Require PKCE as additional verification** option for enhanced security, regardless of your choice Jetstream will always use PKCE when connecting to Okta.

### Configure Jetstream Connection

Enter the Issuer URL in the format `https://{yourOktaDomain}.okta.com` and click "Auto-Discover Endpoints".

:::tip

Look at the URL in your admin dashboard for the format, but remove the `-admin` from the domain.

For example, if your Okta admin dashboard URL is `https://dev-123456-admin.okta.com`, your Issuer URL will be `https://dev-123456.okta.com`.

:::

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Okta application you just created into the corresponding fields in the Team Dashboard when adding the SSO provider.

Click "Save" to finish configuring the connection.

### Enable the connection

After saving the connection, make sure to check the "Enable SSO" checkbox to enable SSO for your team.

You can optionally allow users with specific roles to bypass SSO, by default this is enabled for administrators.

## Configure Okta Workspace for SAML SSO

### Add SSO provider in Jetstream

Choose "Add SSO Provider" from your Team Dashboard and select "SAML" as the provider.

### Create an Application in Okta

Go to your Okta admin dashboard and navigate to **Applications** in the top menu, then click **Create App Integration**.

Choose **SAML 2.0** as the Sign-in method, and click **Next**.

Enter an Application Name

Upload an optional app icon - here are some options:

### Configure SAML Settings

In the SAML Settings, you will need to enter the **ACS URL** and **Entity ID** from the SAML configuration modal within Jetstream into the corresponding fields in the Okta form.

Click **Next** and then **Finish** to create the application.

### Configure Jetstream Connection

Copy the Metadata URL from Okta and paste it into Jetstream in the **IdP Metadata URL** field and press Auto-discover. This will automatically populate the IdP SSO URL and IdP Certificate fields.

Alternatively, you can visit the URL in your browser and copy the contents of the XML file and paste it into the **IdP Metadata XML** field in Jetstream.
