:::info

This feature is available on our Team and Enterprise plans. [Learn more about our plans and pricing](https://getjetstream.app/pricing/).

:::

The Team Dashboard is your central hub for managing team members, configuring login security settings, and monitoring team activity. Access the Team Dashboard by navigating to **Settings > Team Dashboard**.

![Team Dashboard Overview](./team-dashboard.png)

## Overview

The Team Dashboard provides:

- **Team name management**: Customize your team's display name
- **Login configuration**: Control authentication methods and security requirements
- **Team member management**: Invite, activate, deactivate, and manage team member roles
- **Activity monitoring**: View authentication activity and active user sessions (Admin only)

## Team Name

Click the edit icon next to your team name to update it. The team name is displayed throughout the application and helps identify your organization.

## Login Configuration

Configure how team members authenticate and what security requirements they must meet. Changes to login configuration affect all team members on their next login.

### General Settings

#### Require Multi-Factor Authentication

When enabled, all team members must set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) before they can log in. Users without MFA will be prompted to configure it on their next login attempt.

:::tip
Requiring MFA significantly improves your team's security posture by adding a second layer of authentication beyond passwords.
:::

#### Allow linking additional identities

When enabled, team members can link multiple authentication providers (e.g., Google, Salesforce) to their account. This allows users to log in using any of their linked identities.

:::tip
Disabling this option restricts users to a single authentication method, which enhances security but may reduce convenience.
:::

### Allowed Multi-Factor Options

Control which MFA methods team members can use:

- **Authenticator App (OTP)**: Time-based one-time passwords using apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password
- **Email**: Verification codes sent via email

:::info
At least one MFA method must be enabled.
:::

### Allowed Login Providers

Control which authentication methods team members can use to log in:

- **Username + Password**: Traditional email and password authentication
- **Google**: Single sign-on using Google accounts
- **Salesforce**: Single sign-on using Salesforce production environments

:::info
At least one login provider must be enabled.
:::

:::note Salesforce Login
Login with Salesforce requires using a production environment. The connected app name is "Jetstream Auth" and may require installation after the first login attempt. [Learn more about installing the connected app](/docs/getting-started/install-connected-app).
:::

### Saving Changes

After making changes to the login configuration, click the **Save** button in the top-right corner of the Login Configuration card. Modified fields will be highlighted in yellow to indicate unsaved changes.

## Team Members

The Team Members table displays all active members, inactive members, and pending invitations.

### Team Member Information

For each team member, you can view:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many team members can I add?

Our Team plan allows you to add up to 20 team members, while the Enterprise plan supports larger teams with custom limits.

If you are billed using a purchase order, please contact support to increase your license count. Otherwise your license count will be based on the number of users that are active and will be prorated as you add and remove users.

Billing role users do not consume a license.

### What happens when I reach my license limit?

When all licenses are in use, you must deactivate existing users, cancel pending invitations, or purchase additional licenses before adding new team members.

### Can I have multiple admins?

Yes, you can assign the Admin role to multiple team members. This allows shared responsibility for team management.

### How quickly do login configuration changes take effect?

Login configuration changes take effect on the next login attempt. If existing user sessions do not comply with the new configuration, they will be revoked and the user must login again.

The user making the changes is not affected until their next login.

### What happens to deactivated users' data?

Deactivated users' data is preserved. When reactivated, they regain access to their previous work, Salesforce connections, and saved queries.

If you would like to delete a user and their data permanently, contact support.

### Can I see who invited a team member?

The invitation details are tracked in your team's records. Contact support if you need this information.
