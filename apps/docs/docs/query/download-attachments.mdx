:::info

We never store any of your files or other data on Jetstream's servers. The files are streamed from Salesforce, zipped on the fly, and sent directly to your browser.

:::

From the Query Results page, you can download one or more files from Salesforce by performing a query on a supported object and selecting at least one row to download. This will combine all the files into a zip file.

If you are viewing the query results of a supported object, then you will see a link to **Download Selected Attachments** above the records.

:::tip

Our paid plans allow you to download up to 2,000 records at a time, while our free plan allows up to 250 records at a time.

A maximum of 1GB can be downloaded at a time across all files. If you exceed this limit, you will receive an error message.

The desktop application and browser extension, offered with our paid plans, do not have this download record or filesize limit.
