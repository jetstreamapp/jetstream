:::info

We never store any of your files or other data on Jetstream's servers. The files are streamed from Salesforce, zipped on the fly, and sent directly to your browser.

:::

From the Query Results page, you can download one or more files from Salesforce by performing a query on a supported object and selecting at least one row to download. This will combine all the files into a zip file.

If you are viewing the query results of a supported object, then you will see a link to **Download Selected Attachments** above the records.

The following objects allow downloading files:

- Attachment
- Document
- ContentVersion
