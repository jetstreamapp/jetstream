      <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
      <p className="mb-2 pl-2">
        When you visit the Site, we may automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web
        browser, IP address, and time zone. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
        products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the
        Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2 pl-2">We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>
          “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more
          information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
        </li>
        <li>
          “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages,
          and date/time stamps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any information we gather will be used solely for the purpose of improving our product and will not be sold to any 3rd parties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-2 pl-2">
        Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you,
        including your name, billing address, payment information, email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order
        Information.”
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2 pl-2">
        When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order
        Information.
      </p>
      <h2>SALESFORCE DATA</h2>
      <p className="mb-2 pl-2">
        We will never store any of your Salesforce metadata or record data on any of our servers unless explicitly requested by an action
        taken by you, the user. We may store names of Salesforce objects, fields, or other metadata temporarily in logs, but we will never
        persist this beyond our standard log retention policy of up to 1 year and will only use this data for the purpose of troubleshooting
        or other error identification.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2 pl-2">
        We encrypt and store connection details to any Salesforce organization in our database so that you can utilize Jetstream to connect
        to your Salesforce org. We do not have access to or store your Salesforce password, and at any time you can revoke access to
        Jetstream through the Salesforce.com setup menu in the "Manage Connected App Usage" section.
      </p>
      <h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p className="mb-2 pl-2">
        We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your
        payment information and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Communicate with you</li>
        <li>Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud</li>
        <li>
          Based on your preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or
          services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-2 pl-2">
        We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and
        more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact
        with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
      </p>
      <h2>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
      <p className="mb-2 pl-2">
        We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above. For example, we
        use Stripe to power our payment collection. We use Amplitude to track what parts of the application is used and in which ways to
        help make product decisions. We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site - you can read more
        about how Google uses your Personal Information here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also opt-out of
        Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with
        applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to
        otherwise protect our rights.
