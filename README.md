There are multiple ways to use Jetstream.

1. Use the hosted version at https://getjetstream.app
2. Use the desktop version **TODO: COMING SOON**
3. Run locally
   1. Using nodejs
      1. Building yourself (recommended if you want to contribute to the Jetstream codebase)
      2. Using the pre-built version **TODO: COMING SOON**
   2. Using Docker
4. Want to self-host behind your company firewall? Reach out to the team for assistance.

# Getting Started

## Running Locally

**IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE STEPS BELOW, PLEASE FILE A TICKET.**

**Pre-req**

1. Make sure you have node 16 or 18 installed.
2. If you want to run the dev server, make sure you have yarn installed.

📓 You can choose to skip authentication locally by setting the environment variable `EXAMPLE_USER_OVERRIDE=true`. This is set to true by default in the `.env.example` file.
🌟 To use this, don't click the login button, but instead just go to `http://localhost:3333/app` or `http://localhost:4200/app` (if running the react development server) directly.

The easiest way to run Jetstream locally is to download the pre-built and transpiled javascript files and run them using NodeJs.

Jetstream relies on a Postgres database, so you either need to [run Postgresql locally](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or use a managed provider such as one from the list below. Optionally you can run jetstream in a Docker container which includes Postgresql.

- [Render](https://render.com/) (Jetstream is hosted here)
- [elephantsql](https://www.elephantsql.com/plans.html)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/)
- [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres)

You can use the example Salesforce OAuth2 client secret or client id, but you are welcome to create you own connected app in any Salesforce org of your choice.

If you want to create your own:

1. Login to any org where you are an admin, usually a developer org or production org is best
2. Setup > App Manager > New Connected App
   1. name it whatever you want
   2. Click "Enable OAuth Settings"
      1. Callback URL: `http://localhost:3333/oauth/sfdc/callback`
      2. Scopes:
         1. Access the identity URL service `id, profile, email, address, phone`
         2. Access unique user identifiers `openid`
         3. Manage user data via APIs `api`
         4. Perform requests at any time `refresh_token, offline_access`
      3. All other defaults are fine
3. Update the file named `.env` and replace `SFDC_CONSUMER_KEY` and `SFDC_CONSUMER_SECRET` with the values from your connected app.

### Download pre-built application

This is the fastest 🏃 way to run Jetstream locally.

TODO: instructions to download and instructions to run

### Building

⭐ If you want to contribute to Jetstream, this is the best option.

##### Configure environment

- [Install postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  - ensure this is running with a database called `postgres` and a user named `postgres` on default port 5432
    - If your database is cloud hosted or named something different, then you can adjust the environment variable in `.env` after you initialize your application and this file is created.
- [Install node 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - Version 18 is preferred, but 16 will work.
- [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- Install dependencies
  - Run `yarn` to install all dependencies
- Initialize `.env` file
  - `yarn init:project` (or manually copy `.env.example` to `.env`)
  - If you need to adjust your postges connection, you can do so now.
- **Running in production mode**
  - Build application
    - `yarn build` (this may take some time - if the build is cached in the cloud, this may run quickly)
  - Start Jetstream
    - `yarn db:migrate` to initialize database
    - `yarn db:seed` to insert required records for the application
    - `node dist/apps/api/main.js`
    - Visit in a web browser - TODO: **allow skipping auth**
      - `http://localhost:3333/app`
- **Running in development mode - use this option if you want to work with the codebase**
  - Build required applications
    - `yarn build:landing`
    - `yarn build:sw`
    - `yarn db:generate`
  - Start Jetstream
    - terminal 1: `yarn start:api` to start api server
      - This runs on `http://localhost:3333` - most endpoints are prefixed at the `/api` path
    - terminal 2: `yarn start` to start api server
      - This runs on `http://localhost:4200` and you will need to access the application here `http://localhost:4200/app`
  - Optional
    - `yarn start:ui:storybook` to start the storybook server
      - This runs on `http://localhost:4400`
      - You can check out the public version of this at https://storybook.getjetstream.app

### Start Jetstream (with docker)

⚠️ Docker requires a computer with substantial resources.

1. Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
2. Download the pre-built version of the application here **TODO:**
   1. Optionally you can build from sources, following the steps above 👆
3. Run `docker compose up` in your terminal
   1. This may take a while the very first time
   2. If you make any changes, you need to re-build the application using `docker compose build`

## Desktop Application

**TODO: THIS HAS NOT BEEN ENTIRELY WORKED OUT YET**

### Local development

- Start jetstream local server
  - `yarn start`
- Start electron-worker in watch mode (background renderer - rebuild on changes)
  - `yarn start:electron-worker`
- Start electron app
  - `yarn start:electron`

## Packaging

Packaging can only be done by resources that have access to the Apple Developer account.

1. Ensure the following environment variables are set
   1. `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `GH_TOKEN`
2. Ensure all the certificates are installed
   1. Login to [apple.developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list)
   2. Download each certificate
   3. install in system keychain
   4. OR - if that does not work, open xcode > preferences > accounts > Manage certificates > Add App and Developer certificate
3. Build application using Desktop build
   1. `yarn build:electron`
   2. Run `yarn electron:package:concurrently`
      1. Or run each command individually if testing specific build `yarn electron:dist:macos`, `yarn electron:dist:macos-arm64`, `yarn electron:dist:win`
